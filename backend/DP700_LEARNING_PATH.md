    2.  Configure a **Copy Data** activity with a parameterized source pointing to an external Azure SQL Database.
    3.  Map the destination to the `NthDimension_Lakehouse` files repository as JSON format.
    4.  Add a **Notebook** transformation activity to execute after the Copy activity finishes.
    5.  Configure pipeline triggers (schedule and event-based) and test execution via the pipeline canvas.

### 🧪 Lab 03: Build No-Code ETL with Dataflows Gen2
*   **Goal:** Leverage Power Query Online to clean, transform, and load user profiles into a conformed table.
*   **Step-by-Step Exercise:**
    1.  Create a **Dataflow Gen2** item named `Clean_User_Profiles`.

    4.  Configure the **Data Destination** setting, pointing the output to the `FactSales` Lakehouse as a new table `DimUsers`.
    5.  Publish the dataflow, trigger a manual refresh, and check status in the Monitoring Hub.

### 🧪 Lab 04: Advanced Data Transformation using PySpark Notebooks
*   **Goal:** Perform complex, distributed data transformations on millions of records using Apache Spark.
*   **Step-by-Step Exercise:**
    1.  Create a **Fabric Notebook** and attach it to the `NthDimension_Lakehouse`.
    2.  Write PySpark cells to import `DimUsers` and `FactSales` tables.
    3.  Implement data cleansing routines: drop duplicate keys, parse unix timestamps into standard date formats, and calculate lifetime customer spend.
    4.  Save the transformed dataset to OneLake, partitioning the output folder by `TransactionYear` and `TransactionMonth`.
    5.  Validate the partitions visually inside the Lakehouse Explorer tab.

### 🧪 Lab 05: Delta Lake Optimization & Time Travel Operations
*   **Goal:** Manage files, compact tables, and query historical data versions to ensure optimal performance.
*   **Step-by-Step Exercise:**
    1.  Open a Fabric Notebook and load the `FactSales` Delta table.
    2.  Perform multiple simulated record updates and deletes to generate table versions in the Delta transaction log.
    3.  Write a time-travel query using PySpark to fetch records as of version 1:
        ```python
        df_v1 = spark.read.option("versionAsOf", 1).table("FactSales")
        ```
    4.  Run the **`OPTIMIZE`** command to consolidate small files and apply **Z-Order** sorting on the `CustomerID` column for query performance.
    5.  Run the **`VACUUM`** command (setting retention hours to 0) to permanently purge obsolete underlying files.
        > [!WARNING]
        > **Production Warning & Safety Lock Bypass:**
        > Delta Lake blocks vacuuming tables with zero retention by default to prevent irreversible data loss. In a learning sandbox environment, you must override this safety check:
        > ```python
        > # Disable the safety check configuration first
        > spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", "false")
        > 
        > # Run the vacuum command via SQL analytics engine
        > spark.sql("VACUUM FactSales RETAIN 0 HOURS")
        > ```
        > **⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE:** **NEVER** execute `VACUUM` with `0` hours in a production workspace. Doing so permanently destroys all history required for Time Travel and runs a severe risk of table corruption if concurrent write processes are active. Keep the industry default minimum of **7 days (168 hours)** in production.

### 🧪 Lab 06: Implement and Load a Synapse Data Warehouse

    2.  Define Star Schema tables: create tables for dimensions (`DimProducts`, `DimDates`) and facts (`FactInventory`) using standard DDL SQL.
    3.  Load data from the `NthDimension_Lakehouse` Delta tables directly into the warehouse tables using high-performance T-SQL **`COPY INTO`** or **`INSERT INTO...SELECT`** commands.
    4.  Execute analytical queries involving window functions and aggregations in the built-in SQL Query Editor.
    5.  Create a visual query mapping the relationship fields to build the default Semantic Model.

### 🧪 Lab 07: Set Up Real-Time Eventstreams and KQL Databases
*   **Goal:** Ingest real-time telemetry streams and query them using Kusto Query Language.
*   **Step-by-Step Exercise:**
    1.  Create an **Eventstream** named `Live_Telemetry_Stream`.
    2.  Configure a streaming source: select a custom application generator or add a sample IoT device simulator stream.
    3.  Add an Eventstream transformation processor: filter out telemetry logs with temperature values below 50 degrees.
    4.  Create a **KQL Database** inside a Real-Time Intelligence workspace and add it as the eventstream destination.
    5.  Open a **KQL Queryset** and write Kusto queries to analyze continuous trends over 5-minute sliding windows:

        Live_Telemetry_Table
        | where TimeStamp > ago(1h)
        | summarize AvgTemp = avg(Temperature) by bin(TimeStamp, 5m), DeviceID
        ```

### 🧪 Lab 08: Implement Security, Governance & CI/CD Release
