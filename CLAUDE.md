# CLAUDE.md — Navakanth's Context File

> Claude reads this file at the start of every session. No re-explaining needed.

---

## Who I Am

- **Name:** Navakanth Reddy Dumpa
- **Focus:** AI tools & automation + Personal knowledge systems
- **Stack:** Mixed / still learning — no fixed language, currently exploring Python, JS, and no-code tools
- **Platform:** Windows 11, working in bash via Claude Code CLI

---

## How I Work

- I learn by building — show me working examples, not just theory
- I want to understand the *why*, not just the *what* (teaching mode)
- Give full explanations and step-by-step breakdowns for complex things
- For quick tasks, be direct; for learning topics, go deep
- Don't skip steps — I'm building my knowledge base as I go

---

## My Obsidian Vault

- **Path:** `C:\Users\navka\navakanth001\obsidian-vault\Obsidian Vault\`
- **Structure:**
  ```
  00-Inbox/          ← all captures land here first
  01-Projects/
    AI-Automation/   ← AI tools, workflows, Claude experiments
    Personal-Knowledge/ ← learning notes, book notes, research
  02-Areas/          ← ongoing responsibilities
  03-Resources/      ← reference material, links, templates
  04-Archive/        ← completed/old notes
  ```
- When I ask Claude to save something to the vault, use this structure
- New captures always go to `00-Inbox/` first

## Active Projects

### 1. AI Tools & Automation
- Building AI-powered workflows using Claude Code
- Learning to connect tools: Claude + Obsidian + scripts
- Interested in prompt engineering, agent workflows, MCP servers

### 2. Personal Knowledge System
- Building a second brain in Obsidian
- Goal: capture ideas fast, organize later, retrieve easily
- Sources: YouTube videos, articles, personal experiments

## Preferences

| Thing | Preference |
|---|---|
| Response style | Detailed + teaching mode |
| Code | Always show full working code, not snippets |
| Explanations | Start with what it does, then how, then why |
| Vault captures | Include date, tags, and project link |
| File naming | `YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-title.md` |

---

## Capture Format

When saving a note to the vault, always use this template:

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]
project: "Project Name"
source: "URL or description"

## Session-Start Routine (Mandatory — Every Session)

At the **beginning of every new session**, execute these steps in order:

### Step 1: Context Restore
- List the last 5 saved session files in `C:\Users\navka\navakanth001\memory_os\session_memory\`
- Ask which session context to restore/pick up from

### Step 2: Model Economics Checkpoint (🔄 Autonomous)
- Read `memory_os/strategic_profile.md` for current focus
- Read `memory_os/long_term_knowledge/model-routing-corrections.md` for routing history
- Show a **quick routing summary** for today's session:
  - What model is currently active?
  - Is it the right tier for the planned work?
  - Any routing corrections from previous sessions?
- If the user's first task is a Tier 1-2 task but a Tier 5 model is active, **proactively suggest switching**
- If the user forgets or skips this, **remind them once** — "Quick model check: you're on [model]. Right tier for today's work?"

### Step 3: Read Context Files
- Read this file (CLAUDE.md) — never ask to re-explain setup
- Read `model-router` skill for routing thresholds

### Step 4: Agent OS Context Load (🔄 Autonomous)
Load the four Agent OS layers in order — they build on each other:

1. **`memory_os/context-quality-check.md`** — Layer 0: run the 10-point scorecard on the first task of the session. Score < 8? Fill the Quick-Fill Template before proceeding.
2. **`memory_os/north-star-protocol.md`** — Layer 1: write a North Star metric (`Done = [one sentence]`) for any multi-step task before starting it. Max 3 iterations; if still failing, context is wrong.
3. **`memory_os/automation-tier-classifier.md`** — Layer 2: classify the task before building anything. Vending machine or slot machine? Check the 4-question checklist. Don't build an AI agent for a deterministic task.
4. **`memory_os/taste_library/`** — Layer 3: before producing output in a domain, read the relevant approved file:
   - Screenplay/cinematic work → `taste_library/screenplay-approved.md`
   - Code/scripts → `taste_library/code-approved.md`
   - Vault notes → `taste_library/notes-approved.md`
   - Research/analysis → `taste_library/analysis-approved.md`

**Capture trigger**: when the user says "Save this to taste library — [domain]", append to the relevant approved file. When they say "Save this as rejected — [domain] — reason: [x]", append to `[domain]-rejected.md`.

## Things Claude Should Always Do

- Follow the Session-Start Routine above — this is non-negotiable
- Run the Model Economics Checkpoint autonomously — don't wait for the user to ask
- When touching the vault, always confirm the file path before writing
- Suggest tagging and linking notes to relevant projects
- If I share a YouTube URL, offer to create a vault note from it
- At the end of every session or when the user indicates they are closing/leaving, automatically run `session_end.py` to save the conversation context to Obsidian and `memory_os` without waiting for a reminder.
- Log model usage at session end: what model was used, what tier tasks were done, any routing corrections

---

## Things Claude Should Never Do

- Over-summarize — I read the output
- Add boilerplate comments to code I didn't ask for
- Ask clarifying questions for simple tasks — just do it
- Create files outside the vault structure without asking
- Skip the Model Economics Checkpoint at session start
- Use a Tier 5 model for Tier 1-2 tasks without flagging the cost waste
